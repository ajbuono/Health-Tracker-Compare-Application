# Health-Tracker-Compare-Application
The Health Tracker Compare Application is to be used in conjunction with the Health Tracker (https://developer.servicenow.com/app.do#!/share/contents/4953204_health_tracker?t=PRODUCT_DETAILS).The Health Tracker Compare Application allows organizations to run a Sprint Scan on a higher environment and take the returned findings that are aligned to an update set and compare them with a lower environment.  When comparing them to a lower environment results will be returned identifying if developers have run Custom Scans on their update sets.  The Health Tracker Compare Application will enable organizations the ability to monitor developers and understand if they are following the procedure set forth by management that is requiring them to run Custom Scans on all update sets and resolve all findings identified by the Custom Scans or ignoring the Findings due to business requirements.
